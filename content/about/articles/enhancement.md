title: "Enhancement: Custom Theming and Navbar Design"

In this article I explain the enhancement I built into my site.

## What I Changed

- Customized the color scheme and typography using the theme’s SCSS/CSS.
- Built a consistent navigation bar that appears on every page.
- Added hover effects and spacing so the site feels more polished.

## How I Implemented It

Describe which files you edited, such as:

- `layouts/partials/header.html` for the navbar structure
- `assets/css/custom.css` or the theme’s SCSS file for colors, font sizes, and spacing

Include small code snippets and explain them in plain language:

```css
/* Example */
.site-header {
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc;
}
