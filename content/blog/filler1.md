Balancing college academics, athletics, and side hustles can feel like trying to manage three full-time jobs at once. As a student-athlete, my schedule is already packed with classes, practices, lifts, travel, and games. On top of that, I run multiple side businesses and work on developing my skills in finance, cybersecurity, and web development. Even though it’s a lot, I’ve learned that the right mindset and systems make it possible.

One of the most important skills is time management. I’ve learned to treat my calendar like a contract. If something is scheduled, I commit to it—whether it's a workout, homework block, or time to work on a project. This prevents the chaos that happens when everything piles up at once.

Another key lesson is learning to say no. Opportunities pop up constantly, but not all of them move me toward my goals. Being selective keeps me from burning out and allows me to focus on the things that matter most.

Ultimately, balancing all three areas has made me more disciplined, responsible, and confident. Even though it can be stressful, it’s also helping me develop the habits I need for the future.
